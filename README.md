Bletchley Park
--------------

[Bletchley Park](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bletchley_Park), in Milton Keynes,
Buckinghamshire, was the central site of the United Kingdom's _Government Code
and Cypher School_, which during the Second World War regularly penetrated the
secret communications of the Axis Powers â€“ most importantly the German Enigma
and Lorenz ciphers.
